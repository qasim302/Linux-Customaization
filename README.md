Project Implementation
1. Operating System Base

    The ISO was built on the latest stable version of Linux Mint Cinnamon 22, ensuring a reliable and updated operating system environment.
    Cinnamon Desktop Environment was configured and customized as per requirements, maintaining its default structure where applicable.

2. Custom Wallpaper

    The provided wallpaper was successfully integrated as the default desktop background for the custom environment.
    Configuration was set to ensure the wallpaper remains consistent across reboots and sessions.

3. Custom Desktop Folder

    A custom folder named “My Applications” was placed on the desktop, containing shortcuts to the specified applications.
    This folder is the only icon on the desktop aside from the Recycle Bin, presenting a clean, user-focused workspace.

4. Automatic Browser Launch

    Firefox was configured to launch automatically upon login.
    The homepage was set to a local index.html page located in the custom desktop folder, loading as intended every time the OS starts.

5. Connectivity Configuration (WiFi and Bluetooth Disabled by Default)

    WiFi and Bluetooth were both disabled by default through custom configurations in the Network Manager and Bluetooth settings.
    These services can be manually enabled by the user after boot if needed, but remain inactive at each startup to meet security and resource management needs.

6. Bootable USB Creation Compatibility

    The ISO was successfully tested with Rufus, confirming it can be used to create a bootable USB drive.
    Once booted from the USB, the system launches directly into the preconfigured desktop environment with all custom settings and applications in place.

7. Custom Loading Icon

    The provided GIF was successfully incorporated into the Plymouth boot configuration, displaying the custom loading icon during the OS boot process.
    The custom loading screen performs as expected, adding a personalized touch to the boot experience.

Testing and Quality Assurance
